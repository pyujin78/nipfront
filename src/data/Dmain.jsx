      <p>
        A non-fungible token (NFT) is a cryptographic token that represents a unique asset. They function as verifiable
        proofs of authenticity and ownership within a blockchain network. NFTs are not interchangeable with each other
        and introduce scarcity to the digital world.

        Click [Create] and choose your file to upload. We currently support JPG, PNG, GIF, PDF, MP4, MP3, MPEG, AVI,
        WAV, and SVG. Please note that your NFT cannot be changed or revised once created. To create a revised/new NFT,
        you will have to start the process again.

        For fixed price NFT, click the Purchase button on the product page to complete the transaction. If the
        transaction is successful, the NFT will be transferred to the wallet and the seller will receive the funds. In
        the case of auction NFT, you will be eligible to purchase tickets. You can check the successful bid at 9:00 AM
        every day. Transfer is made by 9:00 PM and you will receive NFT when the transaction is completed.

        To list an NFT for sale, our team will first of all approve the content to make sure it’s appropriate for
        listing. This process usually takes 4-8 hours. Upon successful approval, your NFT will list immediately on the
        Marketplace as either an auction or fixed price sale, according to your preference. Alternatively, you can also
        choose to list your NFT at a fixed time (with a minimum of 12 hours after approval).
